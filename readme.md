# WIP progress state

## status

I learned how to connect background <> content script and how to inject html page but I don't like current state of this.
I intentionally didn't wanted to inject react or jquery to the modified websites so I decided to change to `Svelte`.

Now I need to refactor the whole project to use `Svelte` and if it worked correctly maybe I will add some more things to do.

React could be okay also, but there are too many things to make custom to work with

## TODO

1. `React` => `Svelte`.

2. Use `Svelte` in popup and content script.

3. MVP will be when it will work for azure devops pull requests.
